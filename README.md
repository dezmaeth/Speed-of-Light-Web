<H2>Speed of Light HTML5 Game Engine</H2>
<p>
This engine is being develop in order to create an open source game using WEBGL HTML5 standard, the objective is to use canvas to render
diferent particles interaction that spawns from the player, the player being a something like a comet that accelerates on a horizontal
map, avoiding obstacles and crushing others.

This game will be for free, open source, and its supported by <a href="http://mcast.cl">MCAST&reg;</a> 
</p>

	* Changed rendering method from "SetInterval" to "RequestAnimationFrame", for performance and estability reasons.
	
	* Texturized meshes now in place.
	
	* Configuration class file now working properly.
